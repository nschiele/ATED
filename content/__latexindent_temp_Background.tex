Fundamentally, distance measures provide a means of comparison, and means of comparison are critical for any industry. New applications of distance measures are easily found once the distance measure to defined~\cite{beham2011new}. We propose two potential uses of these distance measures; however, future work will further specify new applications. Threat models are a recommended tool for threat analysis~\cite{andersonSecurityEngineeringGuide2020,schneierSecretsLiesDigital2000}. However, once these models are created, they may only be applicable to the analyst or the team of analysts that created them. Unlike other sources of threat intelligence, such as YARA Rules~\cite{naik2019cyberthreat,naik2020evaluating}, there is no means to share attack trees in this format.
