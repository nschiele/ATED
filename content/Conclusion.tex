\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Overall, we have proposed several new approaches for defining distance between attack trees, and have offered a comprehensive comparison between those methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to examine applying the BERT model of semantic embeddings generation to tree distance; further, we are the first to examine tree distance on tree with unfiltered (neither cleaned nor generated) node labels. We have found that traditional tree edit distance applies well with our proposed alterations of semantic similarity to determine node equivalence and an added cost for altering node refinements. Additionally, our proposed distance measure of radical distance is a promising approach for finding distance between trees. We have validated these distance measures and compared them. Finally, we have proposed applications of this research for practical use.

To further this work, we would like to examine the application of semantic similarity to determine node equivalence to potential unordered tree edit distance algorithms. We would also seek to further refine the radical distance measure to better capture the case of tree distance between trees with unequal numbers of radicals. Finally, we would like to apply these distance measures to the problem of automated attack tree generation.
