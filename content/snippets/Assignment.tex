% The following attack \textbf{leaf} nodes are provided. The overall goal of this scenario (and thus the root node of the tree) is \textbf{Rob bank}. Assemble an attack-defense tree using these leaf nodes. Do not add any additional leaf nodes. You may add any intermediary nodes you wish.

% \textbf{Attack leaf nodes:}
% % Why the fuck is there so much space here?
% % \vspace{-10cm}
% % \begin{itemize}
% %   \item Hire Outright
% %   \item Promise part of the stolen money
% %   \item Threaten insiders

% %   \item Buy tools
% %   \item Steal tools
% %   \item Gain Access
% %   \item Walk through front door
% %   \item Locate start of tunnel
% %   \item Find direction to tunnel
% % \end{itemize}

% Hire Outright, Promise part of the stolen money, Threaten insiders, Buy tools, Steal tools, Gain Access, Walk through front door, Locate start of tunnel, Find direction to tunnel

% \textbf{Defense leaf nodes:}

% Personnel Risk Management, Check employee financial situation

% \subsection*{ADT 2: Building ADTs}

% The following text scenario is provided for you. Please create a complete attack defense tree \textbf{of this scenario}. \textbf{Do not add extra information that is not in the scenario}. Try to encapsulate the entire scenario with an attack-defense tree (don't leave any aspect of the attack scenario out).

% \emph{Scenario:} 
% The goal is to open a safe. To open the safe, an attacker can pick the lock,
% learn the combination, cut open the safe, or install the safe improperly so
% that he can easily open it later. Some models of safes are such that they cannot be picked, so if this model is used, then an attacker is unable to pick the lock. There are also auditing services to check if safes and other security technology is installed correctly. To learn the combination, the attacker
% either has to find the combination written down or get the combination
% from the safe owner. If the password is such that the safe owner can remember it, then the safe owner would not need to write it down.

% \subsection*{ADT 3: Using Attack Trees}
This question is slightly different than the other questions. You need to create attack trees only. \textbf{This means you should NOT use defense nodes at all for this question}. In Part I, raw an attack tree from the provided scenario; \textbf{include all information from the scenario, do not include information that is not in the scenario}. In Part II, add onto the provided attack tree with new nodes and refinements that you find through your own research.

\subsection*{AT1: Attack tree from scenario}

\emph{Scenario:}  Many attackers aim to obtain personal data. Gathering personal data can be completed through unauthorized access to profile, credential creep, or a background data attack. Unauthorized access to profile requires gaining user credentials and accessing the profile. The credentials can be gained through a malware attack or a social engineering attack, and the profile can be accessed by stealing a phone or by remote access. Credential creep can be completed by submitting a request for additional data other than what is needed for verification or by user profiling. Finally, a background data attack requires both obtaining a sensitive dataset and linking the dataset via a request for verification. 


\subsection*{AT2: Finding new attack components}

Doing your own research, add at least 5 new nodes and 2 new refinements to the attack tree you created in the previous section.

% \subsection*{ADT 4: Creating ADTs}

% Construct an attack defense tree of a scenario of your choice. Your tree should be complete (covers all reasonable attack scenarios) and reasonably large.
