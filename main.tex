% \begin{abstract}
%     \absSection{Context} Attack trees are a recommended threat modeling method, but there is no established approach to compare them. \\
% \absSection{Objective} We aim to analyze varied distance metrics which are capable of comparing attack tree models produced by human experts, based on both the structure of the tree itself and the meaning of the node labels.\\
%     \absSection{Method} We elicit a set of requirements for attack tree distance measures following from the theoretical underpinning of the model and the usability needs of human experts. We propose a repeatable method of experimental attack tree distance measures validation. To collect a dataset of attack trees that can be used for evaluation and comparison of the measures, we design and execute a human study ($n=39$). We then define four attack tree distance measures (three novel and one established) and compare them on the dataset. \\
% \absSection{Results} From our experimental results, we find that applying semantic similarity as a means of comparing node labels is a valid approach. Further, we find that the tree edit distance (established) and the radical distance (novel) are the most promising methods of comparison in most circumstances.\\
%     \absSection{Conclusion} Our results suggest that these two methods can be used to compare real-world attack trees and to identify similar attack trees. Future research can focus on assessing other metrics based on established attack tree semantics.
