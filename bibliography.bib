We analyze the computational complexities of several variants of this new model. In particular, we show that the problem is NP-complete for ordered trees. We also show for unordered trees that the problem of deciding whether or not the distance is 0 is graph isomorphism complete but can be solved in polynomial time if the maximum outdegree of input trees is bounded by a constant. This distance model is then extended for measuring the diﬀerence/similarity between two systems of diﬀerential equations, for which results of preliminary computational experiments using biological models are provided.},

The state-of-the-art solutions for the tree edit distance are not satisfactory. The main competitors in the field either have optimal worst-case complexity, but the worst case happens frequently, or they are very efficient for some tree shapes, but degenerate for others. This leads to unpredictable and often infeasible runtimes. There is no obvious way to choose between the algorithms. In this paper we present RTED, a robust tree edit distance algorithm. The asymptotic complexity of RTED is smaller or equal to the complexity of the best competitors for any input instance, i.e., RTED is both efficient and worst-case optimal. We introduce the class of LRH (Left-Right-Heavy) algorithms, which includes RTED and the fastest tree edit distance algorithms presented in literature. We prove that RTED outperforms all previously proposed LRH algorithms in terms of runtime complexity. In our experiments on synthetic and real world data we empirically evaluate our solution and compare it to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstractnote = {Ordered labeled trees are trees in which the left-to-right order among siblings is significant. The distance between two ordered trees is considered to be the weighted number of edit operations (insert, delete, and modify) to transform one tree to another. The problem of approximate tree matching is also considered. Specifically, algorithms are designed to answer the following kinds of questions: 1. What is the distance between two trees? 2. What is the minimum distance between T 1 and T 2 when zero or more subtrees can be removed from T 2 ? 3. Let the pruning of a tree at node n mean removing all the descendants of node n. The analogous question for prunings as for subtrees is answered. A dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the three questions in sequential time O(|T 1 |×|T 2 |×min(depth(T 1 ),leaves(T 1 ))×min(depth(T 2 ),leaves(T 2 ))) and space O(|T 1 |×|T 2 |) compared with O(|T 1 |×|T 2 |×(depth(T 1 )) 2 ×(depth(T 2 )) 2 ) for the best previous published algorithm due to Tai [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 26, 422-433 (1979; Zbl 0409.68040)]. Further, the algorithm presented here can be parallelized to give time O(|T 1 |+|T 2 |).}
