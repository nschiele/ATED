	abstract = {We consider the classical tree edit distance between ordered labeled trees, which is defined as the minimum-cost sequence of node edit operations that transform one tree into another. The state-of-the-art solutions for the tree edit distance are not satisfactory. The main competitors in the field either have optimal worst-case complexity, but the worst case happens frequently, or they are very efficient for some tree shapes, but degenerate for others. This leads to unpredictable and often infeasible runtimes. There is no obvious way to choose between the algorithms. In this paper we present {RTED}, a robust tree edit distance algorithm. The asymptotic complexity of {RTED} is smaller or equal to the complexity of the best competitors for any input instance, i.e., {RTED} is both efficient and worst-case optimal. We introduce the class of {LRH} (Left-Right-Heavy) algorithms, which includes {RTED} and the fastest tree edit distance algorithms presented in literature. We prove that {RTED} outperforms all previously proposed {LRH} algorithms in terms of runtime complexity. In our experiments on synthetic and real world data we empirically evaluate our solution and compare it to the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose tree edit distance with variables, which is an extension of the tree edit distance to handle trees with variables and has a potential application to measuring the similarity between mathematical formulas, especially, those appearing in mathematical models of biological systems. We analyze the computational complexities of several variants of this new model. In particular, we show that the problem is {NP}-complete for ordered trees. We also show for unordered trees that the problem of deciding whether or not the distance is 0 is graph isomorphism complete but can be solved in polynomial time if the maximum outdegree of input trees is bounded by a constant. This distance model is then extended for measuring the diÔ¨Äerence/similarity between two systems of diÔ¨Äerential equations, for which results of preliminary computational experiments using biological models are provided.},

The computation of text similarity is the basic task for many natural language processing problems, and it is an open research Ô¨Åeld. Syntactic n-grams are text features for Vector Space Model construction extracted from dependency trees. Soft similarity is application of Vector Space Model taking into account similarity of features. First, we discuss the advantages of the application of the {TED} to syntactic n-grams. Then, we present a procedure based on the {TED} and syntactic n-grams for calculating soft similarity between texts.},

	doi = {10.1137/0218082},
	abstract = {Ordered labeled trees are trees in which the left-to-right order among siblings is significant. The distance between two ordered trees is considered to be the weighted number of edit operations (insert, delete, and modify) to transform one tree to another. The problem of approximate tree matching is also considered. Specifically, algorithms are designed to answer the following kinds of questions: 1. What is the distance between two trees? 2. What is the minimum distance between T 1 and T 2 when zero or more subtrees can be removed from T 2 ? 3. Let the pruning of a tree at node n mean removing all the descendants of node n. The analogous question for prunings as for subtrees is answered. A dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the three questions in sequential time O({\textbar}T 1 {\textbar}√ó{\textbar}T 2 {\textbar}√ómin(depth(T 1 ),leaves(T 1 ))√ómin(depth(T 2 ),leaves(T 2 ))) and space O({\textbar}T 1 {\textbar}√ó{\textbar}T 2 {\textbar}) compared with O({\textbar}T 1 {\textbar}√ó{\textbar}T 2 {\textbar}√ó(depth(T 1 )) 2 √ó(depth(T 2 )) 2 ) for the best previous published algorithm due to Tai [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 26, 422-433 (1979; Zbl 0409.68040)]. Further, the algorithm presented here can be parallelized to give time O({\textbar}T 1 {\textbar}+{\textbar}T 2 {\textbar}).},
